Product Requirement Document: Autonomous Operations Suite (Hackathon Prototype)

1. Product Name: Autonomous Operations Suite

2. Problem Statement: Retailers often struggle with sub-optimal inventory levels, reactive pricing strategies, and uncoordinated promotions, leading to waste, missed sales opportunities, and reduced profitability. Traditional, rule-based systems are too slow and inflexible to adapt to real-time market changes. This prototype aims to address these challenges by providing a proactive, intelligent system for retail optimisation.

3. Product Goal (Hackathon Scope): To build a multi-agent Generative AI (GenAI) prototype that proactively optimises inventory, pricing, and promotions in real time to reduce waste and maximise profit within a simulated retail environment. The prototype should effectively demonstrate the collaboration between specialised AI agents.

4. Target Users:

    Retail operations managers

    Store managers

    Merchandising teams

5. Key Features & Functionality (Agent Roles & Responsibilities): The suite will consist of three collaborating specialised AI agents:

    5.1 Pricing Agent

        Core Responsibility: Dynamically adjust product prices to maximise profit and reduce waste.

        Key Inputs: Real-time demand elasticity, competitor prices, inventory levels.

        Key Outputs: Profit-weighted price moves, micro-discounts.

        Collaboration Point: Negotiates with the Inventory Agent to apply markdowns on at-risk stock.

    5.2 Inventory Agent

        Core Responsibility: Maintain optimal stock levels and trigger restocking.

        Key Inputs: Probabilistic demand forecasts, IoT shelf data (simulated), lead-time models.

        Key Outputs: Self-calibrating safety buffers, restocking alerts.

        Collaboration Point: Informs the Pricing Agent of slow-moving items to trigger price adjustments.

    5.3 Promotion Agent

        Core Responsibility: Orchestrate flash sales and create promotional bundles.

        Key Inputs: Social media sentiment (simulated), event schedules, SKU performance data.

        Key Outputs: On-the-fly bundle creation, pre-allocation of stock to fulfilment centers (simulated).

        Collaboration Point: Collaborates with the Pricing Agent to create micro-discounts and with the Inventory Agent to ensure stock availability.

6. Architecture & Technical Considerations (Hackathon Focus):

    Architecture Type: Multi-agent system (Centralised/Orchestrator model is recommended for hackathon simplicity).

    Foundational Components:

        Large Language Model (LLM): The central reasoning engine for agent decision-making.

        Data and Memory Layer: A vector database to serve as agents' "persistent memory" for recalling past interactions, user preferences, and product information. This layer will leverage a small, high-quality, first-party dataset (simulated or representative).

        Execution Layer: APIs and tools that agents can access to perform tasks (e.g., updating simulated inventory, applying simulated price changes).

    Recommended Tools (Hackathon Stack):

        Generative AI Model: AWS Bedrock models

        Vector Database: ChromaDB

        Agent Framework: AWS Strands Agents

        Execution Layer: FastAPI or pre-built connectors.

        User Interface: Python/Streamlit, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a simple web interface.

7. Success Metrics (Hackathon Evaluation): The prototype will be considered successful if it can:

    Clearly demonstrate the collaborative interaction between the three specialised agents.

    Showcase how complex, real-world retail problems can be decomposed and solved by a team of collaborating bots.

    Visually represent how the system proactively optimises key retail metrics (e.g., reduces simulated stockouts, adjusts prices based on simulated demand).

    Provide a clear, value-led demonstration of GenAI's capability to drive efficiency and reduce waste in retail operations.

8. Out of Scope (for Hackathon Prototype):

    Full-scale enterprise integration with live inventory, CRM, or POS systems.

    Extensive, real-world data foundation and data cleaning processes (focus on a representative dataset).

    Production-ready security, scalability, and robust error handling.

    Decentralised multi-agent architecture (will focus on a centralised orchestrator model).
