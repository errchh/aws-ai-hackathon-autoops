# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Langfuse observability platform to provide comprehensive workflow visualization for the AutoOps retail optimization system. The integration will track agent interactions, decision-making processes, and performance metrics triggered by the simulation engine, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of the multi-agent system's behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to visualize agent workflows in real-time, so that I can monitor system performance and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation engine triggers an event THEN the system SHALL log the trigger details to Langfuse
2. WHEN an agent processes a request THEN the system SHALL create a trace in Langfuse with agent identification and processing steps
3. WHEN agent collaboration occurs THEN the system SHALL track inter-agent communication as spans within the trace
4. WHEN an agent completes a task THEN the system SHALL record completion status, duration, and output metrics in Langfuse

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to trace individual agent decision paths, so that I can debug and optimize agent behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an inventory agent makes a decision THEN the system SHALL log input parameters, reasoning process, and output recommendations
2. WHEN a pricing agent calculates prices THEN the system SHALL trace calculation steps, market data inputs, and final pricing decisions
3. WHEN a promotion agent creates campaigns THEN the system SHALL record campaign parameters, target criteria, and expected outcomes
4. IF an agent encounters an error THEN the system SHALL capture error details, context, and recovery actions in the trace

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to view aggregated workflow metrics, so that I can analyze system efficiency and ROI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Langfuse dashboard THEN the system SHALL display agent performance metrics including response times, success rates, and throughput
2. WHEN analyzing workflows THEN the system SHALL provide filtering capabilities by agent type, time period, and trigger source
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL aggregate data across multiple simulation runs and agent interactions
4. WHEN comparing performance THEN the system SHALL show trends and patterns in agent behavior over time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to configure observability settings, so that I can control what data is collected and how it's stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Langfuse integration THEN the system SHALL allow setting of API keys, project settings, and data retention policies
2. WHEN enabling tracing THEN the system SHALL provide granular control over which agents and operations are monitored
3. IF privacy concerns exist THEN the system SHALL support data masking and selective logging capabilities
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL implement sampling strategies to reduce observability overhead

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want seamless integration with existing infrastructure, so that observability doesn't impact system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Langfuse THEN the system SHALL maintain existing API response times within 5% degradation
2. WHEN tracing is enabled THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous logging to prevent blocking operations
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and graceful degradation for Langfuse connectivity
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support hot-swapping of observability configurations without system restart
