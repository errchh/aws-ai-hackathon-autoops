# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The autoops retail optimization system is a multi-agent Generative AI prototype designed to proactively optimize inventory, pricing, and promotions in real-time within a simulated retail environment. The system consists of three specialized AI agents (Pricing, Inventory, and Promotion) that collaborate to reduce waste and maximize profit through intelligent decision-making and real-time adaptations to market conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a retail operations manager, I want a multi-agent system that can automatically optimize pricing, inventory, and promotions, so that I can reduce waste and maximize profitability without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL consist of three distinct AI agents (Pricing, Inventory, Promotion)
2. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust pricing, inventory levels, and promotions within 5 minutes
3. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the system SHALL log all agent interactions and decision rationales
4. IF any agent fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with remaining agents and alert administrators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a store manager, I want dynamic pricing adjustments based on real-time data, so that I can maximize profit and reduce waste from overstocked items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demand elasticity changes THEN the Pricing Agent SHALL adjust prices to optimize profit margins
2. WHEN inventory levels are high for slow-moving items THEN the Pricing Agent SHALL apply markdowns in coordination with the Inventory Agent
3. WHEN competitor prices change THEN the Pricing Agent SHALL evaluate and potentially adjust prices within competitive ranges
4. WHEN price changes are made THEN the system SHALL track profit impact and effectiveness metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a merchandising team member, I want optimal inventory levels maintained automatically, so that I can prevent stockouts while minimizing carrying costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demand forecasts are updated THEN the Inventory Agent SHALL recalculate optimal stock levels and safety buffers
2. WHEN inventory falls below optimal levels THEN the Inventory Agent SHALL generate restocking alerts with recommended quantities
3. WHEN items become slow-moving THEN the Inventory Agent SHALL notify the Pricing Agent to trigger price adjustments
4. WHEN IoT shelf data indicates low stock THEN the system SHALL automatically update inventory records and trigger restocking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a retail operations manager, I want a modern, interactive web dashboard built with Streamlit to monitor agent activities and system performance, so that I can oversee operations and intervene when necessary through an intuitive interface with 6 dedicated sections showcasing each user story.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the Streamlit dashboard THEN users SHALL see 6 distinct sections, each corresponding to a user story requirement with real-time status and activities
2. WHEN agents make decisions THEN each section SHALL display a table showing: trigger detected, concise reasoning text, value before change, and value after change
3. WHEN system metrics change THEN the dashboard SHALL update key performance indicators with interactive Streamlit charts and real-time data visualization
4. WHEN critical issues occur THEN the dashboard SHALL display alerts and recommended actions using Streamlit alert components and notifications
5. WHEN users interact with the dashboard THEN the interface SHALL provide responsive interactions with Streamlit's native components and auto-refresh capabilities
6. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN each section SHALL clearly demonstrate the corresponding user story with tabular data showing decision triggers, reasoning, before/after values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the multi-agent system to maintain persistent memory of past decisions and outcomes, so that agents can learn and improve their decision-making over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the system SHALL store decision context, rationale, and outcomes in the vector database
2. WHEN similar situations arise THEN agents SHALL reference past experiences to inform current decisions
3. WHEN querying historical data THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant past interactions within 2 seconds
4. WHEN the system restarts THEN all agent memory and learning SHALL persist and be immediately available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a retail operations manager, I want the system to simulate realistic retail scenarios for demonstration purposes, so that I can evaluate the system's effectiveness before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running simulations THEN the system SHALL generate realistic demand patterns, competitor pricing, and market events
2. WHEN demonstrating capabilities THEN the system SHALL show measurable improvements in key metrics (reduced stockouts, optimized pricing, coordinated promotions)
3. WHEN simulating market changes THEN agents SHALL respond appropriately and demonstrate collaborative decision-making
4. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL provide clear visualizations of agent interactions and performance improvements
